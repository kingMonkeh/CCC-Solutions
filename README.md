# CCC-Solutions

Hello.

These are my CCC solutions that I've created as I practice for the CCC.
There's also solutions to non CCC problems like UVa problems.

I try my best to write an analysis for each question that I answer, as to help others understand the solution to the problem. But some solutions are really hard to explain using only text, so I apologize if something doesn't make sense.

You may see a difficulty indicator in my analysis. This difficulty is completely subjective.
How I rate difficulty:

Very Easy - The answer instantly came to me with only one read, I wrote a full mark solution in less than 5 minutes.

Easy - The answer came to me after a minute or two, implementation took about 5-10 minutes.

Medium - The answer came to me after a solid 15 minutes of thinking. Implementation may take 15 minutes to 1 hour.

Hard - I had no clue how to answer this problem, I looked up a solution online and wasted 4 hours trying to understand it. Dozens of failed implementation attempts, several days of thinking.
